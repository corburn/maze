Maze
====

Maze was an entry in the Tyler Technologies 2013 Programming Challenge. The task was to take a png maze as input and create a user interface. Optionally, the program could provide hints and/or generate new mazes. Everything else was left to the creativity of the individual or team. 

Everything except maze.png, which belongs to Tyler Technologies, is licensed under the GPLv3 or later.

To run the program, open index.html in a web browser that supports HTML5. If using Chrome or Chromium, it must be run from a webserver. Using a file path URI will throw a cross-origin security error.
